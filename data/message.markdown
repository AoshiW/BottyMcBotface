Hey there! I'm Botty, let me be the first to welcome you to the Riot API Discord :)

Here's some tips to help you on your way:
1. There's a good chance the AnswerHub already has an answer for you. Be sure to search there, it will help you much faster. https://discussion.developer.riotgames.com/
3.  If you have any questions about the Riot API, I recommend you post them in #riot-api. Please don't ask if you can ask a question, just ask it! If someone knows the answer, they will respond, while "Can I ask a question?" will rarely be replied to.
4. The pins in the Riot API channel might hold some resources that are not on DDragon. If they're not in the pins, be sure to check out CommunityDragon. http://cdragon.stelar7.no/
5. Heimerdinger is a bot in the server that will help you with the API. Just paste any Riot API url and it will give you the results that it should return. Make sure that your key is not in the URL! Heimerdinger will add his own. 
6. Heimerdinger can tell you the status of the API with `!status`.
7. You can follow the updates of the forum posts in #external-activity.
8. Be sure to read the rules! #rules-faq

The commands I have right now are:
`!note list`: Gives you a list of notes that I have. The shorthand of these notes is `.`, for example: `.repo`, which is the same as `!note repo`, which links to the repository where my code is located!
`!uptime`: How long I've been online.
