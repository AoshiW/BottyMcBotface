Hey there! I'm Botty, let me be the first to welcome you to the Riot API Discord :)

Here's some tips to help you on your way:
1. There's a good chance the AnswerHub already has an answer for you. Be sure to search there, it will help you much faster. https://discussion.developer.riotgames.com/
2. If you have any questions about the Riot API, I recommend you post them in #riot-api. Please don't ask if you can ask a question, just ask it! If someone knows the answer, they will respond, while "Can I ask a question?" will rarely be replied to.
3. The pins in the Riot API channel might hold some resources that are not on DDragon. If they're not in the pins, be sure to check out CommunityDragon; http://stelar7.no/cdragon/latest/
4. I can help you find issues in your url, and also show you the results. Just paste any Riot API url and I will work my magic. Make sure that your key is not in the URL!
5. You can check the status of the API with `!status`.
6. You can follow the updates of the forum posts in #external-activity.
7. Be sure to read the rules! #rules-faq

Finally, even though Riot Games doesn't endorse any libraries, we want you to be able to contact the developers of libraries. If you want to discuss something about a specific library, you can mention the developers of that library, if available. For example, you can mention the Cassiopeia devs with `@Cassiopeia devs`. This is **not** for debugging your application, but for discussions about the library itself. The available mentions are `@Cassiopeia devs`, `@Kayn devs` and `@Orianna devs`.

The commands I have right now are:
